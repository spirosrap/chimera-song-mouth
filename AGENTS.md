# CHIMERA

A physical-modeling voice synthesizer: a Rust engine (wasm in an AudioWorklet, native for tests
and the CLI) under a React UI. See the README.

## Working here

- Do what was asked, the simplest way. Side work nobody asked for (experiments, tooling, paid
  runs) is a proposal with its cost. If the work grows well past the estimate, stop and say so.
- Before repeating or reversing earlier work, read its history (`git log -- <path>`, `git log -S`).
- Commit small. The subject names what changed and the trap, in searchable words; the body gives
  the why, what you ruled out, what you ran (with numbers) and what you didn't test.
- Keep each fixed bug's reproduction as a test.
- Code outranks this file: fix the file when they disagree. When something breaks unnoticed, add
  a rule here, with a check.

## Map

- `crates/chimera/`: the engine (no I/O). `crates/chimera-wasm/`: the browser's C ABI.
  `crates/chimera-cli/`: `chimera render | compare csd | compare tsp | diagnose | calibrate`.
- `src/wasm/`: the UI's facade over the engine. `src/worklet/`: the AudioWorklet. `src/ui/`: React
  and the canvas renderers.
- `tests/`: bun tests on the wasm build. `tools/`: e2e, layout lint, spectrogram, speech judges
  (`asr/` Whisper, `tsp/` the real speakers' data).
- `docs/`: architecture, the engine contract (`rust-engine.md`), the UI look, the singer and
  speech judges, and the hill-climb rules.

## Rules

- **The engine's contract** (`docs/rust-engine.md`): transcendental math only through
  `chimera::math`, no allocation while rendering, output independent of block size. `cargo test`
  enforces each.
- **Any change to the sound or the plans fails the golden tests, by design.** Re-bless with
  `CHIMERA_BLESS=1 cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`, run twice. Human-voice audio, plans
  (including the beat sounds' gestures and the beat player), the tract geometry and the human
  airway's transfer functions re-bless; see `crates/chimera/tests/golden/README.md` for the rest.
- **`*.generated.json` tables are regenerated (`chimera calibrate`, `tools/gen-*`), never edited.**
  Vowel calibration isn't bit-reproducible, so rerun it only when the formants should move.
- **This portable edition tracks `src/wasm/chimera.wasm` for Bun-only static hosting.** After a Rust
  change, rebuild and commit it with `bun run wasm`; `bun test tests` alone tests the old engine.
  Use `bun run test`. Do not share a cargo `target/` between checkouts.
- **Gesture records are defined twice**, in `crates/chimera-wasm/src/lib.rs` and
  `src/wasm/wire.ts`. Change both and bump `LAYOUT_VERSION`.
- **The wasm loads before the UI.** A module that calls the engine at import must not be reachable
  from `src/main.tsx`'s static imports. Check: `bun tools/e2e.ts` against `bun run preview`.
- **Recorded band heads own model leases for their mounted lifetime.** Do not hold an evictable live-preview model in a recorded feed; MEGALOVANIA has 13 body blends, beyond the eight-entry cache. Check: `bun test tests/model-leases.test.ts`.
- **DOM content flows in `.screen-body`, never absolutely positioned.** Check: `bun run lint:layout`.
- **This handoff explicitly includes the user-requested prepared music/movie assets.**
  Keep all eleven songs and all three scenes in `public/`; read `CONTENT.md` and `MEDIA-RIGHTS.md`.
  The upstream copyright exclusion does not apply to this explicitly requested export. CSD
  datasets, original input recordings and analysis caches are not included. Do not add them.
  After intentionally changing public assets, run `bun run content:manifest` and commit the
  manifest together with the assets. `bun run verify:content` must pass before a static build.
- **Voice tuning follows `docs/hill-climb/README.md`** and never edits its judges.

## Checks

| When you touch | Run |
|---|---|
| anything | `bun run test` and `bun run typecheck` |
| `crates/chimera/` sound | re-bless goldens (above); `cargo run --release -q -p chimera --example bench` against the previous commit |
| `crates/chimera-wasm/`, `src/wasm/`, `src/worklet/`, `src/main.tsx` | `bun run build && bun run preview`, then `bun tools/e2e.ts` |
| `src/ui/`, `src/show/`, CSS | `bun run lint:layout` |

## Portable hosting handoff

Read `HANDOFF.md` first. This is an independent repository; the previous ChatGPT Site identity
and credentials were deliberately omitted. Do not reattach or change the old Site.
Use `bun run build:static` to deploy unchanged engine code without Rust. A full Rust rebuild
uses `bun run build`. Deploy all of `dist/` at the root of an HTTPS origin, including `.tele.gz`.
The inherited `EDITION-NOTES.md` describes prior development; its historical references to
ignored media do not describe this portable repository.
